 Nvidai RTX 3090 add to cart bot.
 
Find 3090 and 3080 cards in stock at Newegg or Bestbuy

Use this behind a proxy or VPN. 

This tool will find an in stock gpu, and send your phone an add to cart link for bestbuy, or a product link on newegg that will have apple pay. This should speed up the checkout process quite a bit. 

Features to integrate:
1. Autocheckout (I had this working prior to the 3080 launch. After the 3080 launch bot detection has increased quiet a bit. It is very hard to not be seen as a bot so I may not fully integrate this feature again. I honestly believe it is faster to just checkout with saved information in your browser to avoid avoid bot detection. 

2. Add product selection options. Currently it checks for all models of 3080/3090s in stock. I will take whatever I can get so I have been running it on everything. I will be adding a user selection method in the near future.

I am open to suggestions! Please let me know of any features you think would help you get a 3090/3080!
